# 3. Objective
Help foreigner to read the menu.

# 4. What
Hong Kong is a international city. Residents in Hong Kong might not able to read  chinese. 

In order to have a lunch / dinner in local restaurant, they always need to carry a local person for menu translation. 

The goal of this application is to automatic that translation process and reduce the human resouces FoodRader will be a nice solution. 

The mission of FoodRader is help non-local person to place an order including read, pronounce and imagine the dish.

# 5. How
In order to build a self service order placing application, crowdsource will become our standpoint. Every local restaurants will have some local customer, that we can collect an image, cantinese pronounce and GPS from those local customers as wall as the feedback with each dish. 

Mobile will be we primary platform to serve the customer.

Firebase will be a nice solution to store the data.
