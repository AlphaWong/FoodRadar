# Abstract
FoodFader aims to help the foreigner to place order in cantonese 

# What
Hong Kong is an international city. Residents in Hong Kong might not be able to read chinese. 

In order to have a lunch / dinner in local restaurant, they always need a local person for menu translating. 

The goal of this application is to automate that translation process and reduce the human resources. 

The mission of FoodRader would like to help non-local person to place an order including read, pronounce and imagine the dish.

# How
In order to build a self service order placing application, crowd sourcing will become our standpoint. As many of educated local people able to understand the context of menu in local restaurant. Also, selfie seems become a local well known culture that they willing to post their photo to share network that we just need to offer a share button which will draw their attention.

Meaning we can collect an image, cantonese pronounce and GPS from those customers as wall as the feedback with each dish. 

Mobile will be our primary platform to serve those customers.

Firebase will be a nice solution to store the data.

# Why
FoodRander enables those non-chinese customer to place an order via show the image, pronunciation and ranking based on their current GPS and local time.
